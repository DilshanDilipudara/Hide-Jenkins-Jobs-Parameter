# Jenkins Job Hide String Parameter

**Overview**

Jenkins pipelines often involve several string parameters, some of which need to be concealed from the user interface for security reasons. This is particularly important when handling sensitive information such as credentials or API keys. In our Jenkins environment, we have over 200 jobs, and ensuring that specific parameters remain hidden is crucial to safeguarding our infrastructure and data.

**Objective**

The primary objective of this process is to configure Jenkins jobs in a way that conceals specific string parameters, preventing them from being exposed to Jenkins users during job execution or configuration.

**Approach**

Write a Python script to identify the string parameter and replace it using hide parameter tags for all jobs..

**Conclusion**

By implementing a systematic approach to hiding sensitive string parameters in Jenkins jobs, we enhance the security of our CI/CD pipelines and protect critical information from unauthorized access.
